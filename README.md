# Asleep SDK Android Sample App
A sample application that demonstrates how to utilize Asleep SDK in Android.

## How to run
1. Generate an API Key [here](https://docs-en.asleep.ai/docs/dashboard-generate-api-key).

2. Enter your API Key in local.properties
   `asleep_api_key = "yourKeyHere"`

3. Run the app and review the details in the [Sample App Documentation](https://docs-en.asleep.ai/docs/sample-app).

## Next step
Start adopting the Asleep SDK with the [Asleep Documentation](https://docs-en.asleep.ai/docs).

## Prevent the app from termination due to updates
To prevent the app from application exit due to updates (e.g. WebView, GMS), <br> you separate the Foreground Service into a distinct process.
